## For Each Interview

At the start of each interview, you'll receive a .zip file containing an interview pattern. An interview pattern is a coding challenge that includes:
- Problem description and requirements
- Starter code and test cases
- Implementation details and tips

To set up the pattern:
1. Extract the pattern's .zip file
2. Drag and drop the extracted folder into the `src/interviews` directory  
3. The pattern will automatically appear in the interface
4. Click on the pattern to begin the challenge

That's it! You're now ready to start coding. Codeflow provides a timer and clean interface to help you complete the challenge.

Good luck with your interview!
