# Interview Challenges

This directory contains your interview challenge files. When you receive interview materials from your interviewer, they'll automatically be discovered and loaded by Codeflow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Receive interview materials** from your interviewer (usually a zip file)
2. **Extract the folder** into this directory: `src/interviews/`
3. **Restart the development server** (`Ctrl+C` then `npm start`)
4. **Done!** Your interview challenge appears automatically in the main interface

**✨ Zero Configuration Required ✨**
- No files to edit
- No imports to add  
- No configuration to update
- Just drop and restart!

## 📁 What's in Your Interview Files

Your interview challenge will typically include:

```
your-challenge-name/
├── index.ts              # Challenge configuration
├── YourComponent.tsx     # Where you'll implement your solution
├── styles.css           # Styling for your component
├── mockData.ts          # Sample data (if needed)
└── any-other-files...    # Additional resources
```

## 🔧 How It Works

Codeflow automatically detects and loads your interview challenge:

- **Automatic Discovery** - No manual configuration needed

## 🎯 Your Workflow

1. **Extract** your interview files to this directory
2. **Restart** the development server
3. **Click** on your challenge in the main interface
